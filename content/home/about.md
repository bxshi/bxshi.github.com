# Biography

Hey this is Dash! I'm a Computer Science graduate student at University of Notre Dame under the supervison of [Dr. Tim Weninger](http://www3.nd.edu/~tweninge/). My research interests include Knowledge Graph Completion and Heterogeneous Information Network Mining using Deep Learning methods.

When I'm not doing academic research, I usually work on applying my models to large-scale, real world products and applications. My work has been adapted to production systems at Bing during a summer Internship.

When I'm not researching or selling my ideas to companies, I spend my time on music and movies a lot.
